# ToAsc
This is a vim plugin to change quotes and dashes to ascii characters

This plugin will change all unicode quote marks (single and double) and the long and short dashes to ascii characters.

By default it will operate on the entire file. Should it be desired to use it on a portion of the file, use Vim's visual selection features to limit the portion of the file to which this plugin will work before running the plugin.

This plugin is a modified version of traviswsims/vim-straight-quotes plugin.

My version is licensed under the GPL version 3 license.
